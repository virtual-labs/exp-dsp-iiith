### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

  -  Basic knowledge of [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) (data structure)
  -  Familiarity with data structures such as [queues and priority queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)).
  -  Calculation of basic time and space complexity.
  -  Intuition about the Greedy Choice Algorithms
  -  Knowledge about Graph Traversal Algorithms
  - And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore..!

### Overview of the Experiment

   - The aim of this experiment is to understand the Dijkstra’s Shortest Path algorithm, its time and space complexity, and how it compares against other shortest path algorithms.
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures,interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes to self analyze.
