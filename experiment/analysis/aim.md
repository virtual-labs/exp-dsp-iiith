### Learning Objectives of this Module:

In this module, we will be learning about:

   - Time and Space complexity: We will learn about the running time of one iteration, and then extend it to N iterations to complete the sorting process.
   - Comparison with other algorithms: We will compare Bubble sort with other sorting algorithms and see in which situations Bubble sort is the optimal/not optimal approach to take.
